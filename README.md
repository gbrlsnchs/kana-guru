## [kana.guru](https://kana.guru)

kana.guru is a free, open-source website for transliterating romaji text to hiragana and
katakana. The core engine runs in the browser itself using WebAssembly, and is based on my
other project, [kana](https://git.sr.ht/~gbrlsnchs/kana).

Note that kana.guru doesn't send the input to any servers, as it runs locally in the browser.

A mirror is located at [GitHub](https://github.com/gbrlsnchs/kana-guru). Feel free to give it
a star if you feel like it. :-)
